# Downtempo（緩拍）

> Emergence: Early 90s

Chill-out is a loosely defined form of popular music characterized by slow tempos and relaxed moods. The definition of "chill-out music" has evolved throughout the decades, and generally refers to anything that might be identified as a modern type of easy listening. Some of the genres associated with "chill" include downtempo, classical, dance, jazz, hip hop, world, pop, lounge, and ambient.

緩拍音樂（又名緩拍、慢搖，英文：downtempo）是一種類似於氛圍音樂的電子樂，但更加強調節奏，並不像痴哈樂那樣具有自然氣息。

Downtempo is the result of various urban genres (including genres from the Urban scene) looking to chill the fuck out.

For sure there were slower paced examples of Jazz, RB, Funk, Dub, and Soul for as long as those genres have existed. Downtempo brought them all together into the same lounge, handed them all a nice fat spliff and let the magic happen as DJs blended their various vibes together.
